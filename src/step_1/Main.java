/**
 * Data collection
 * ---------------
 * Description
 * We will start by implementing the flowchart below. Copy the messages carefully and assign them to the program
 * variables. It makes no difference whether you make a list or each message is a separate variable. The appropriate
 * messages must be displayed according to the flowchart.
 * [image_step_1]
 * ---------------
 * Objectives
 * Implement the flowchart above. Please, follow our recommendations:
 * The variable calc should have the following format: x operation y. For example: 2 + 3, 2 + g or 3.1 r 5;
 * The variables x and y must be of the float or int type. The oper variable is a one-character string. Check whether the passed values have proper types. The delimiter must be a dot;
 * Copy the messages below carefully. The tests will check if the correct message appears in the correct order. Please, do not add extra lines or characters.
 * msg_0 = "Enter an equation"
 * msg_1 = "Do you even know what numbers are? Stay focused!"
 * msg_2 = "Yes ... an interesting math operation. You've slept through all classes, haven't you?"
